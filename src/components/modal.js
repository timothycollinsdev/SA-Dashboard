              <b>The Living Lab</b> is working to better understand social
              interactions and economic behavior within the various communities
              across South Australia in order to introduce new solutions to help
              economic growth and to contribute to employment in South
              Australia. This part of the project includes the design and
              development of a dashboard for visualizing various types of
              behavior and economic activity in South Australia. The basis of
              this dashboard is founded on the labâ€™s previous studies which
              support the notion that the diversity of interactions and social
              bridges between neighborhoods accurately predict neighborhood
              economic growth. This tool is used to assist the stakeholders in
              South Australia in pinpointing focus areas for urban development
              to drive greater diversity in human flow, or more interactions
              between people of different socio-economic backgrounds, and
              consequently more economic opportunities.
